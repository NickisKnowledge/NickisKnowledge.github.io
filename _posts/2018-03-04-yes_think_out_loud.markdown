You are not a crazy person for talking to yourself! You’re really just thinking out loud. This is SUPER important when you’re trying to figure something out, learn something new, or teach something. The following will explain some of the perks of utilizing the think out loud technique as a programmer.

**Problem Solving**  <br />
I have found that simply reading code aloud clarifies numerous things. When you read words out loud it narrows your focus. This is key to pinpointing a problem. Also, articulating yourself helps you express your opinion and forces you to explain your reasoning and thought process. In an article that examines the *thinking out lou*d process, written by Ph, D Noa Kageyama he states:

> When we focus on what we are doing and why we are doing it (whether we are verbalizing these out loud or not), we can not only solve problems more efficiently but transfer those solutions to similar new problems we might encounter later.
> 

**Education** <br />
Learning to code is like building a house, one of the first steps are to lay a foundation, and then build upon that. Talking out loud helps to internalize what you’re reviewing. Therefore, as you continue to expand your knowledge often you will reference lots of information, *thinking out loud* makes this connection second nature. Furthermore, this process helps you assess your understanding of what you are studying.

**Coaching** <br />
When someone is helping guide another person as they program both parties are learning. The teacher gains an understanding of how the student expresses and comprehends code, while their student *thinks out loud*. And the pupil (unconsciously) examines their decision-making processes as they are explaining their work. This process really works best when implemented in a conversational manner.

There is an abundance of articles that talk about the advantages of the *talk out loud* process. Hopefully, this one will cause you to try it out and **not** feel weird or crazy. Becoming an exceptional developer takes time and practice, this process can greatly aid in this goal.
