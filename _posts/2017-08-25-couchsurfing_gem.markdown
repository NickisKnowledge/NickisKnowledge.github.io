As Avi said the toughest part of building code is figuring out where to start! Throughout my time on learn, I've always had a framework and detailed instructions to follow, but for this project and partly for the Tic Tac Toe game I was lost.

I found the idea of using Couchsurfing as a gem because of Corrina. During a study 
group Corrina said, to pay attention to the framework the web-page is built from when choosing a website to scrape. So I googled -- the programmer best friend! -- 'websites built with ruby on rails'. And to my surprise a ton of articles were written about various websites built on R.o.R! This was step one for me.

Step two was watching and mimicking Avi in the CLI Gem Walkthrough video. Man,
this video saved my life! It got me going and then I just took off! Like a rocket
soaring into outer space. This project was tough! But not as hard as the TicTacToe 
project, in my opinion! I've had a LOT of 'set-backs' but I'm really proud of my
finished project! After you get the ball going on a program, things start flowing 
and then you hit problems which lead to successes, failures, craziness and fun.
But hey, I've climbed the first Ruby mountain and am proud to have it under my
belt!

Here's an overview of my gem: It will allow you to travel around the world and find F.R.E.E lodging, pretty much anywhere. The program starts with prompting the user to select a continent from a displayed list of continents (some of which were created by Couchsurfing, which is pretty cool!). From the users selection a list of five (random) countries from that continent are then displayed and the user is prompted to choose again. Of course the next selection are the cities and the final are the available hosts for the city.

I have to say that the Scraper code really challenged my programming skills. Every time I thought I had my code right, I hit a new issue. That was very, very frustrating but it's provided me with an excellent learning experience! But in the past couple of days, figuring out how to make my gem execute from the command line was quite a doozy. But with the help of JJ Seymour my gem OFFICIALLY works after installation with the call of its name, couchsurfing.

This project created quite an adventure for me, in my everyday and programming
life. I hope this gem does the same for you! Go travel around the world and
meet someone new! =D
