That's really how I feel right now! This language and I DEFINTELY have a love/hate relationship! But overall I think JavaScript is pretty cool and surely helps make websites more 'user friendly.' 

Adding JavaScript and jQuery have definitely upgraded my *Easy Reservations* site. It's created faster results when viewing a hotels rooms, posting a review and even displaying a particular review. And we all know the importance of speed. It allows the user to multitask on the site without having to wait around for a page to refresh or load. And most importantly it's tested my knowledge of the Rails framework (especially the helpers!), as well as put my JS skills to the test!

As my github summary states, the *Easy Reservations* site has been through a nice makeover! But a component that I haven't talked about much is how my JavaScript handles bad data. My BFF Google helped me figure out how to deal with this very real issue. All I needed to do was trigger my fail function and pass in my errors. After doing some research I learned I could pass the Rails object errors to the json object and also attach an 'unprocessable entity' status code of 422 with my json object, which would trigger the fail function. Figuring this out was SUPER interesting and enlightening! 

There's still so much I don't know and with every project I become even more aware of my limited knowledge. But that doesn't bother me, because I love to learn and it has only made this process more enjoyable and frustrating all in one!
