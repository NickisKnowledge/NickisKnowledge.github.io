OK, I have officially created **my first program completely from scratch**! Well, from scratch with guidance from Flatiron. And my program is...🎶*drum roll* please🎶: Tic Tac Toe! 🎉 

**My game actually works**!!! 😄😄

This is a major WIN for my life, period! My daughter even hugged me and said "Mommie, I'm so proud of you!" 😍😍

Honestly this past month has been incredibly hard for me to code. I've had so much going on, but somehow I found a way to do some programming every night. Working through the Intro to Ruby Development section was easy at first, but then I hit some hard parts that took me a day or two to understand. But hey, I did it! I not only passed the labs but actually understand what is going on! I officially feel like a real developer! 😃😁

So I just thought I would share this Programmer-Life-Win, which is actually a Life-Win, with the world! 👍

Thanks for reading & sharing in my joy! 
🤗 😀
