While debugging one of the final labs with a Learn TC I said, ‘I can’t wait to get to my final project!’ And his response was 'well, the final project is quite a doozy!'

 And he wasn’t lying!

Writing code in two VERY different languages was pretty mind boggling but, an essential tool to master. Nevertheless, the icing on the cake is getting these languages to work together. I have to say, this final project definitely made my wheels turn, and *‘Mr.React’*, was not very helpful, LoL!

**Dinner-n-10 showcases the power of integrating two frameworks!** I am a DIE-HARD Rubiest and Ruby on Rails fan, Javascript and I have our days, but React, Redux and I just don’t seem to get along!

However, I am aware that React and Redux are the future. And since I definitely don’t want to be left behind, I refuse to give up on this relationship! I mean, I have built a whole functional application with this framework. Speaking of which, let me highlight some of it’s features:

1. Dinner-n-10 is a cookbook of recipes that take AT MOST 10 steps to create.

2. It allows the user to browse dinners supplied through an API, which I built, as well as add and or remove a dinner or two.

3. The form to add a dinner is pretty notable. It features dynamic form fields as well as an image upload system, neither of which Learn explicitly taught how to do, (thank you Google!).

Even with all that, I’m sure you’re saying, *‘O, that’s nothing fancy’, right?'*

Well in case you didn’t know, this site is a SPA, Single Page Application, *(did you know that acronym?)*

Redux is what’s allowing my navigation system to work along side with React. Using their snazzy ‘Browser Router’, ‘Link’ and ‘Switch’ components when a user clicks on one of the navigation links, the page transforms itself to display the associated component.

And that my friends, is my cherry on top!
