<p>Hello visitor, thanks for checking out my page! So you would like to learn more about 'little-old-me' ðŸ˜ƒ that's awesome!ðŸ˜„ Well, the first thing that you should know is that I love the "Programmer-Life'!! It's complex, frustrating and yet very rewarding, and of course, you can't forget F.U.N.! ðŸ˜‰ </p>

<p>I am currently enrolled at Flatiron on the Full Stack Web Development with React track. I am a college grad with a Bachelor's degree in the language of Art in Spanish which I use regularly.  I read, write, speak and love this language!ðŸ’š A very futuristic goal of mine is to learn to code in Spanish once I have mastered coding in English. ðŸ˜Œ</p>

<p>As well as being a full-time student in school, I am also a C.R.A.Z Y. full-time mom! ðŸ˜œ I have an eager to learn three-year-old that's FULL of energy. She keeps me VERY busy, therefore, I have become a master multi-tasker. ðŸ˜‰</p>

<p>So there you have it. A few snippets of my life: I'm a newbie programmer on a very long and complex learning path while trying to take on parenthood! </p>

<p>~HORRAY!!! Let's take on the day!~
